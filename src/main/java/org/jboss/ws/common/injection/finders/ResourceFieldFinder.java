/**
 * Field based resource injection.
 *
 * To access a resource a developer declares a setter method and annotates it as being a
 * resource reference. The name and type of resource maybe inferred by inspecting the
 * method declaration if necessary. The name of the resource, if not declared, is the
 * name of the JavaBeans property as determined starting from the name of the setter
 * method in question. The setter method must follow the standard JavaBeans
 * convention - name starts with a 'set', void return type and only one parameter.
 * Additionally, the type of the parameter must be compatible with the type specified
 * as a property of the Resource if present.
