/**
 * @PostConstruct method finder.
 *
 * The PostConstruct annotation is used on a method that needs to be executed after dependency injection is done
 * to perform any initialization. This method MUST be invoked before the class is put into service. This annotation
 * MUST be supported on all classes that support dependency injection. The method annotated with PostConstruct MUST
 * be invoked even if the class does not request any resources to be injected. Only one method can be annotated with
 * this annotation. The method on which the PostConstruct annotation is applied MUST fulfill all of the following criteria:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The method MUST NOT have any parameters.
 *   <li>The return type of the method MUST be void.
 *   <li>The method MUST NOT throw a checked exception.
 *   <li>The method on which PostConstruct is applied MAY be public, protected, package private or private.
 *   <li>The method MUST NOT be static.
 *   <li>The method MAY be final.
 *   <li>If the method throws an unchecked exception the class MUST NOT be put into service.
 * </ul>
