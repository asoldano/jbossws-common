/**
 * @PreDestroy method finder.
 *
 * The PreDestroy annotation is used on methods as a callback notification to signal that the instance
 * is in the process of being removed by the container. The method annotated with PreDestroy is typically
 * used to release resources that it has been holding. This annotation MUST be supported by all container
 * managed objects that support PostConstruct except the application client container in Java EE 5.
 * The method on which the PreDestroy annotation is applied MUST fulfill all of the following criteria:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The method MUST NOT have any parameters.
 *   <li>The return type of the method MUST be void.
 *   <li>The method MUST NOT throw a checked exception.
 *   <li>The method on which PreDestroy is applied MAY be public, protected, package private or private.
 *   <li>The method MUST NOT be static.
 *   <li>The method MAY be final.
 *   <li>If the method throws an unchecked exception it is ignored.
 * </ul>
